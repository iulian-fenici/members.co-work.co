        <h3>Things you might want to know about Co-Work Borough</h3>
        <p>Welcome,</p>

        <p>This page is designed to help you make the most of your office.</p>

        <p>We have provided a number of links on the right hand side of the page which we hope will help you to settle in and answer some of the questions you might have from how to scan a document to where can I get hold of a Co-Work mug.</p>

        <p>To start with you will have been sent a login email inviting you to join the group and confirm your profile. By doing so a basic profile has been created showing your name and email address. If you would like to add any further information to your profile in the way you would on Facebook etc such as an address, phone number or photo to show to other users within the office please feel free but this is not compulsory.</p>

        <p>At the top of the page you will also see a number of other icons that include an office update tab where we can post notes and news, a twitter tab where anyone can sent out short messages with a requests you might have i.e. "anyone got a spare iphone charger" or do you know how to find a good sandwich nearby! Next to the little birdie there is the meeting room icon which allows you to check availability and book the meeting rooms. The last of the icons is the company directory which shows the other companies working around you.</p>

        <p>Finally this is a brand new Intranet system so apologies in advance for any bugs you might find and please email us or pop over with any comments or suggestions you might have as to how we can improve it going forward</p>

        <p>Tom</p>
