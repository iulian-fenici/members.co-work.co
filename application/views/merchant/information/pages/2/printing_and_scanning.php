        <h3>Printing and scanning</h3>
        <p>Next to the Kitchen you will find our print area with the Brother Printer and Scanner.</p>

        <p>We provide use of the printers on communal use under our fair use policy. This means that you're more than welcome to use the printer or scanner on an ad-hoc basis but please don't use it as a full time business tool i.e. for mail shots or hundreds of presentations</p>

        <p>To scan a document you will need a memory stick.</p>

        <p>If you have any further questions or want some help on how to use the printer or scanner please don't hesitate to contact us on <a href="mailto:tom@co-work.co">tom@co-work.co</a></p>
