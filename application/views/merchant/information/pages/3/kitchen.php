        <h3>The Kitchen</h3>
        <p>Other than the coffee machine there are few other things to point out regarding the kitchen.</p>

        <p>You will probably notice we don't have a kettle but not to worry you can still make a cup of tea or a hot chocolate in record time. You will notice an instant boiling hot water tap. Its pretty self explanatory so really the only thing to say is be careful it actually is boiling hot so please don't try to use it to wash your hands! Pull the hot tap to the side and hold down until the water is ready.</p>

        <p>Other than that - all we ask is that everyone tries to keep the kitchen generally tidy.</p>

        <p>All members are given their own mug when they start but if you need extra mugs for visitors etc please let Matt or I know.</p>
