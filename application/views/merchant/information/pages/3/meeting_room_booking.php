        <h3>Meeting Rooms</h3>
        <p>The meeting rooms are free of charge and bookable via the meeting room icon above. Once you arrive on the calender page click the "book a meeting room" link and book away.</p>

        <p>Meeting rooms are subject to our fair use policy and can be booked for slots of up to 2 hours at a time. If your meeting is cancelled please remember to remove it from the system.</p>

        <p>Please do not block book meeting rooms as this is unfair to your Co-Workers. Please try and ensure you limit your meetings to two hours and leave a gap of 1-2 hours between use of the rooms to allow others the option to benefit.</p>
