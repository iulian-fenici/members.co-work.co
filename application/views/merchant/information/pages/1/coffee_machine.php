        <h3>The Coffee Machine</h3>
        <p>Probably one of the best features in the office! </p>
        <p>The machine is pretty self explanatory and someone will go through the basics when you first arrive. All you really need to do is put your cup under the spout and press the type of coffee you want. </p>
        <p>Only other things to mention are; </p>
        <p>1) If you're the first in or it runs out of milk please take some from the fridge and top up the milk fridge to the left of machine accordingly.<br>
            2) If the machine runs out of coffee please fill up the coffee bean tubes on the top of the machine from coffee beans in the cupboard.<br>
            3) It the "Dump box is full" pull out the drip tray and its positioned behind. Empty it into the bind and replace. </p>
        <p>Anything else just ask Matt or I and we will do our best to help! </p>
