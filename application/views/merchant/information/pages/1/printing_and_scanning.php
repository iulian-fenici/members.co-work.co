        <h3>Printing and Scanning</h3>
        <p>At the back of the office you will find our New Brother Printer.</p>

        <p>We provide use of the printers on communal use under our fair use policy. This means that you're more than welcome to use the printer or scanner on an ad-hoc basis but please don't use it as a full time business tool i.e. for mail shots or hundreds of presentations.</p>

        <p>For scanning this is most efficient from a memory stick.</p>

        <p>If you have any further questions please don't hesitate to ask one of your fellow co-workers or contact us on <a href="mailto:tom@co-work.co">tom@co-work.co</a></p>
